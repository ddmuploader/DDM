Because of JPF's reasons, we sometimes can not find a sequence of successes during the run.
In order to obtain a successful sequence, we made some changes to some test files or artificially create some files.


Jdk62:We manually create the target file to be tested in advance
Log4j:We reduced the number of threads that were staggered in the original test file and the number of loops of program execution.
